During a hackathon we made a travel recommendation system that takes into account the happiness of the destination. 

During a 24 hours Hackathon our group, consisting of 4 people, made a rudimentary travel agent that suggests trips based on the destinations happiness. See the video for the visual results.

The project consists of:
- Twitter data scrapping and some data cleaning. Done by me
- Evaluate the messages using the microsoft azure API
- Using the SkyScanner API to request the prices for the flights
- Front end developing, making into one whole.

## Fun bit

The project was done in the weekend using historical data we noticed that on a certain day it spain was very happy and a good travel destination. A quick internet search revealed Real Madrid had won a home game that day.
