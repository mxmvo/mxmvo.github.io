title: (In progress) Saliency in the Arcade
---

Combining eye tracking data with arcade games. Using the eye tracking lab we set up on experiment that will see where the subjects are looking when they are playing a game. 

There has been developments that try to extract saliency from agents as well. Our question is whether those saliencies coincide. 

A futuristic question would also be to see if we can use the human saliency to make the learning of the agent more effective.
