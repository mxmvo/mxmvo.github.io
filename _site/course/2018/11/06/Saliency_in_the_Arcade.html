<p>Where does and agent ‘look’, does it base its decision on the same information as humans?</p>

<p>Here we investigate the ‘saliency’ of an reinforcement learning agent. In the article of <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1711.00138">Greydanus</a>, they introduce a method, that describes the amount of information a certain area of the playing field has. This results in a measure of ‘saliency’. In this experiment we let people play pong. A human saliency map is constructed from the extracted eye-tracking data. Then we will see the relation between the agents’ saliency and the human’s saliency.</p>

<h1 id="results">Results</h1>
<p>Using the KL-divergence as a method of dissimilarty between saliency maps. We see that the human’s are in general looking at the same area as the agent is extracting its information from. The agents only is not always ‘looking’ when it does not have any affect on the game, while the humans are in general following the ball. Furthermore an agent can ‘look’ at multiple areas aswell. These does results do effect the eventual results.</p>

<h1 id="side-quest">Side Quest</h1>
<p>Could we use the eye-tracking data from the humans as a catalyst for the agents learning method. Inspiration came from <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1806.03960">article</a>, so initially we made a saliency predictor and precompossed this with an agent.</p>
<h2 id="saliency-predictor">Saliency Predictor</h2>
<p>For the saliency prediction we used the human-saliency a a ground truth and we tried to predict where the human was looking. As architecture the image of the playing field was convoluted down three times, the get an abstract representation, from the representation we used the transpose convolution to get the original sized image again. Instead of a memory cell, we gave the predictor 4 sequential images. As a cost function we used the KL-Divergence with regularization, as optimizer the Adam optimizer.</p>

<p>This part is still in progress.</p>
